# Java-Reverse_String
This Java program reverses a string by iterating through its characters in reverse order. It prompts the user to enter a string, then uses a for loop to extract each character from the last index to the first using charAt(i). Each character is printed with a space. Note that s.next() reads only one word, ignoring spaces in input.
